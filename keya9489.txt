GAME =>

  A History Bee (HB) is a two player game with an additional person as the judge. We will call those P1, P2, and J.
  The J gives ("sends") each player a question, such as "When was the war of 1812?" P1 and P2 try to respond as quickly as possible,
  The J sees their responses (if any) and responds to each in time order (first one submitted, if correct, gets points, if not correct,
  looks at the other player's submission, continue on for a maximum of 4 attempts, or as soon as one is correct.) The J gives feedback
  to each responce (OK, NO), Each player gives their name at the start, and each player sees both names and the scores.
  Each player starts with N points (set by J), and a correct answer score +1 point, an incorrect answer -2 points) 
  To ensure that the game is fair, all questions and responses are logged in a text window that only the J sees, 
  each line (entry) in the format:
  [time, originator] message text 
  for example:
  [0, Joe] Where is the Alamo?
  [12, Pat] In Dallas
  [14, Judge] NO
  [50, Penny] San Antonio
  [51, Judge] OK
  The time may either be in seconds since the game began, or the actual system time if you prefer. On the J screen show current time
  in either format.
  The J at anytime may restart the game.


 10. Show the J instance (without logging, yet).

 11. Show P1 and P2 instances.

 12. Show us, let us play, the game.
